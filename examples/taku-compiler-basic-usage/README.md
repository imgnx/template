# Taku Compiler Basic Usage (TypeScript)

This example shows how to instantiate the converged `taku` compiler, register plugins, and run a mock compile.

- Entry: `basic-usage.ts`
- Uses: `taku/src` TypeScript library

To run (from repo root):

- Install deps: `npm install` (Node 18+)
- Execute with ts-node: `npx ts-node taku-converge/examples/taku-compiler-basic-usage/basic-usage.ts`

Note: This is architectural scaffolding â€” hooks fire and log, generation steps are placeholders.
